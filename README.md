## Addition Information

This plugin is a continuation of the current one built into HA. I have reused sa small amount of code so credit to the developers (@jhollowe, @Corbeno). However most has been rewritten to bring it in line with current HA standards and includes a lot more functionality!

Currently this is only avaliable as a custom repo but will look at updating the built in one in HA down the line.
